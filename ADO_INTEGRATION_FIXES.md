# Azure DevOps Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Test Results Not Being Published ✅
**Problem:** Test results were not being sent to Azure DevOps after test execution.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `CSBDDRunner` to call `publishTestResult()` in the finally block of each test
- Added proper metadata extraction from Gherkin tags (@TestCaseId, @TestPlanId, @TestSuiteId)
- Ensured metadata keys match between CSBDDRunner and CSTestRunManager

### 2. Test Run Not Being Completed ✅
**Problem:** Test run was created but remained in "InProgress" state and never completed.

**Solution:**
- Moved test run completion from `@AfterClass` to `@AfterSuite` to ensure all tests are done
- Added `publishTestResults()` call before `completeTestRun()` to ensure all results are sent
- This ensures proper order: Create Run → Execute Tests → Publish Results → Complete Run

### 3. Attachments/Screenshots Not Being Uploaded ✅
**Problem:** Screenshots were not being uploaded to Azure DevOps.

**Solution:**
- Fixed screenshot directory path in `CSEvidenceUploader` (now checks `target/screenshots`)
- Added support for multiple screenshot directories
- Upload only recent screenshots (within 5 minutes) to avoid uploading old files
- Added logging to track screenshot uploads

### 4. Missing Step Definitions ✅
**Problem:** Some Gherkin steps in ADO test scenarios didn't have matching step definitions.

**Solution:**
- Added missing step definitions to `OrangeHRMSteps.java`:
  - `I should see the dashboard page`
  - `the dashboard header should display {headerText}`
  - `I should see an error message containing {errorText}`
  - `I should remain on the login page`

## How to Use

### 1. Set PAT Token
```bash
export ADO_PAT_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
./test-ado-bdd.sh
```

Or directly with Maven:
```bash
mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=suites/ado-bdd-suite.xml
```

### 3. Verify Integration
```bash
./verify-ado-integration.sh
```

## Configuration
The ADO configuration is in `resources/config/application.properties`:
- Organization: mdakhan
- Project: myproject
- Test Plan: 417
- Test Suite: 418
- Test Cases: 419, 420

## Test Execution Flow
1. **Test Run Creation**: Creates a new test run in ADO with test points
2. **Test Execution**: Runs BDD scenarios with ADO tags
3. **Result Publishing**: Publishes test results with outcome (Passed/Failed)
4. **Evidence Upload**: Uploads screenshots from target/screenshots
5. **Run Completion**: Marks test run as completed with all results

## Files Modified
- `src/main/java/com/testforge/cs/bdd/CSBDDRunner.java` - Added result publishing in @AfterSuite
- `src/main/java/com/testforge/cs/azuredevops/managers/CSEvidenceUploader.java` - Fixed screenshot directory
- `src/test/java/com/orangehrm/stepdefs/OrangeHRMSteps.java` - Added missing step definitions
- `src/test/java/com/orangehrm/pages/DashboardPageNew.java` - Added getHeaderText() method

## Verification
After running tests, check Azure DevOps:
1. Go to https://dev.azure.com/mdakhan/myproject/_testManagement
2. Look for the test run (e.g., "BDD Test Run - 2025-08-12...")
3. Verify:
   - Test run status is "Completed"
   - Test results show Pass/Fail outcomes
   - Screenshots are attached to test results
   - Test points are updated with latest results
