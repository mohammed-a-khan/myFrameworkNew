# Parallel Execution Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Thread Safety - Data Isolation
- **Problem**: Multiple threads were sharing the same scenario data objects
- **Fix**: 
  - Created deep copies of scenarios in `CSBDDRunner.createScenarioCopy()`
  - Modified `CSFeatureParser` to create new HashMap instances for data rows
  - Each thread now gets its own isolated copy of test data

### 2. DataProvider Configuration
- **Problem**: DataProvider had `parallel = false`
- **Fix**: Changed to `@DataProvider(name = "featureFiles", parallel = true)`

### 3. Maven Surefire Configuration
- **Problem**: pom.xml had restrictive settings preventing parallel execution
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed `<parallel>none</parallel>` and `<threadCount>1</threadCount>`
  - Added `<dataproviderthreadcount>3</dataproviderthreadcount>`

### 4. TestNG Suite Configuration
- **Problem**: Suite file had `parallel="Methods"` (incorrect case)
- **Fix**: Changed to `parallel="methods"` (lowercase)

### 5. WebDriver Thread Safety
- **Already Good**: CSWebDriverManager uses ThreadLocal<WebDriver>
- **Enhanced**: Added fallback in CSStepDefinitions to get driver from CSWebDriverManager

### 6. Placeholder Replacement
- **Problem**: Step placeholders weren't being replaced with actual data values
- **Fix**: Added placeholder replacement in CSScenarioRunner.executeFileStepWithResult()

### 7. Synchronization
- **Added**: 500ms delay in test execution to ensure driver initialization
- **Added**: Verification that driver is not null before test execution

## How Parallel Execution Should Work Now

1. TestNG creates multiple threads (up to 3 based on thread-count)
2. Each thread gets its own:
   - WebDriver instance (via ThreadLocal)
   - Scenario copy with isolated data
   - ScenarioRunner instance
3. Steps are executed with proper data replacement
4. No shared state between threads

## To Run Parallel Tests

```bash
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=suites/testng-data-driven-examples.xml
```

## Expected Behavior

- 3 browser instances open simultaneously
- Each browser executes a different test with its own data
- No blank values or data mixing
- Faster overall execution time

## If Issues Persist

1. Check for static variables in test/page classes
2. Verify no shared state in step definitions
3. Enable debug logging to trace execution
4. Monitor thread names in logs (TestNG-PoolService-0, 1, 2)
