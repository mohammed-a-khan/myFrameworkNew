# Test Execution Summary

## Framework Status: ✅ Working

The CS TestForge Framework is successfully executing tests with the following features:

### What's Working:
1. **Framework Core**: All compilation issues fixed
2. **Property Configuration**: Using standardized dot notation (browser.name, browser.headless, environment.name)
3. **Test Execution**: Tests are running via Maven and TestNG
4. **BDD Support**: Feature files are being parsed and executed
5. **Step Definitions**: Clean syntax without type specification
6. **Reporting**: HTML reports are being generated
7. **Screenshots**: Failure screenshots are being captured

### Test Results:
- **Simple Login Tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Data-Driven Tests**: ⚠️ Some failing due to:
  - Missing/incorrect test data files
  - Element locator changes in the application
  - Timing issues with page loads

### Key Achievements:
1. **Consolidated Structure**: Single step definition file (OrangeHRMSteps.java)
2. **Clean Syntax**: No step type required - `@CSStep(description = "...")`
3. **Flexible Steps**: Any step can be used with any Gherkin keyword
4. **Direct Suite Execution**: No custom runner needed, uses CSBDDRunner directly
5. **Property Management**: Consistent property naming with application.properties

### To Run Tests:
```bash
# Quick run with defaults (headless Chrome)
./run-tests.sh

# Run with specific browser
./run-tests.sh firefox false qa

# Run with Maven directly
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=suites/orangehrm-tests.xml
```

### Configuration:
- **Suite File**: `suites/orangehrm-tests.xml`
- **Properties**: `resources/config/application.properties`
- **Feature Files**: `features/orangehrm-simple-tests.feature`, `features/orangehrm-comprehensive-tests.feature`
- **Step Definitions**: `src/test/java/com/orangehrm/stepdefs/OrangeHRMSteps.java`

### Next Steps for Full Success:
1. Update element locators in page objects to match current application
2. Add proper test data files with correct structure
3. Add appropriate waits for dynamic elements
4. Adjust test scenarios based on actual application behavior

The framework is fully functional and ready for use!
