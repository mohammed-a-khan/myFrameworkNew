# Report File Cleanup Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Redundant Report Files
**Before:** cs-reports folder contained redundant files:
- `test-report_*.html` - Duplicate redirect files
- `report-data.json` - Duplicate JSON data

**After:** These files are no longer created in cs-reports root

### 2. Clean Folder Structure
**New Structure:**
```
cs-reports/
├── latest-report.html     (Simple redirect to latest test-run)
├── history/               (Optional - for trend tracking)
├── trends/                (Optional - for trend analysis)
└── test-run-TIMESTAMP/    (Actual reports)
    ├── index.html         (Main report)
    ├── report-data.json   (Report data)
    └── screenshots/       (Test screenshots)
```

### 3. Files Modified

#### CSReportManager.java
- Removed creation of `test-report_*.html` in cs-reports root
- Removed creation of `report-data.json` in cs-reports root
- The HTML report generator already handles everything in test-run folders

#### CSHtmlReportGenerator.java
- Keeps `latest-report.html` as a simple redirect
- Creates all report files only in test-run folders
- No changes needed here as it was already correct

## Benefits

1. **No Redundancy**: Single source of truth for each test run
2. **Cleaner Structure**: Only necessary files in cs-reports root
3. **Better Organization**: Each test run is self-contained
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Less files to manage and clean up

## Verification

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
./test-report-cleanup.sh
```

This will confirm:
- No `test-report_*.html` files in cs-reports root
- No `report-data.json` in cs-reports root
- Only test-run folders and optional history/trends folders
- `latest-report.html` exists as a redirect

## Summary

The framework now has a clean report structure:
- **Screenshots**: Only in test-run folders (no redundancy)
- **Report files**: Only in test-run folders (no redundancy)
- **Root folder**: Contains only redirect and optional history/trends

This complements the earlier screenshot cleanup, creating a fully optimized report generation system with no redundant files anywhere.
