# Example Proxy Configuration for Corporate Networks
# ====================================================
# Copy these settings to application.properties and update with your company's proxy details

# Enable proxy for WebDriverManager driver downloads
proxy.enabled=true

# Your company's proxy host (replace with actual values)
# Examples:
#   proxy.mycompany.com
#   192.168.1.100
#   proxy-server.internal
proxy.host=proxy.mycompany.com

# Your company's proxy port (replace with actual value)
# Common ports: 8080, 3128, 8888, 80
proxy.port=8080

# Optional: If your proxy requires authentication (most corporate proxies don't)
# Leave empty if not required
proxy.username=
proxy.password=

# Optional: Hosts that should bypass the proxy
# Usually includes localhost and internal servers
proxy.nonProxyHosts=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.internal.mycompany.com

# All other settings remain the same
# The framework will automatically use the proxy for:
