# BDD Test Execution Summary

## Execution Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS

The data-driven BDD test execution ran with the following results:

### ‚úÖ Data Processing Success
- All external data sources were successfully loaded
- Feature file was parsed correctly
- Scenarios were expanded from outlines with actual data

### üìä Scenarios Generated

From the data-driven-demo.feature file, the following scenarios were generated:

1. **Excel/CSV Data (3 scenarios)**
   - Create products from Excel/CSV [Laptop Pro 15]
   - Create products from Excel/CSV [Office Desk]
   - Create products from Excel/CSV [Wireless Mouse]

2. **CSV Inventory Data (3 scenarios)**
   - Update inventory from CSV [SKU001]
   - Update inventory from CSV [SKU002]
   - Update inventory from CSV [SKU004]

3. **JSON API Data (2 scenarios)**
   - API testing with JSON data [POST /api/users]
   - API testing with JSON data [PUT /api/users]

4. **Properties Configuration (1 scenario)**
   - Environment configuration test [QA Environment]

5. **Special Characters CSV (4 scenarios)**
   - Handle special characters [Simple text]
   - Handle special characters [Text with 'quotes']
   - Handle special characters [Special chars: @#$%]
   - Handle special characters [Line with newline]

**Total: 13 scenarios generated from 5 scenario outlines**

### ‚ùå Execution Failures

The scenarios failed during execution because:
- **Missing Step Definitions**: The step "I am on the application" has no matching step definition
- **WebDriver Issues**: Chrome DevTools Protocol warnings (not critical)

### üîç Key Observation

The framework successfully:
1. ‚úÖ Loaded data from all external sources (Excel/CSV, JSON, Properties)
2. ‚úÖ Applied filters correctly (e.g., Environment=QA, UpdateRequired=Yes)
3. ‚úÖ Expanded scenario outlines with data rows
4. ‚úÖ Replaced placeholders with actual values
5. ‚ùå Failed at runtime due to missing step implementations

### üìù Example Data Expansion

```gherkin
Original:
  When I create a product with name "<ProductName>"
  
Expanded:
  When I create a product with name "Laptop Pro 15"
```

### üöÄ Next Steps

To make the tests pass:
1. Implement the missing step definitions
2. Register step definition classes with CSStepRegistry
3. Ensure WebDriver configuration is correct

### üí° Conclusion

The data-driven testing framework is working correctly. The failures are due to missing test implementations, not the data-driven functionality itself. All 13 scenarios were properly generated and attempted to execute with their respective data values.
