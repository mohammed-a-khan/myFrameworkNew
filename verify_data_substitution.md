# Data Substitution Verification

The data-driven functionality IS working correctly. Here's the evidence:

## CSV File Content (testdata/invalid_credentials.csv)
```
username,password,errorMessage
invalid,wrongpass,Invalid credentials
Admin,wrongpass,Invalid credentials
"",admin123,Invalid credentials    <-- Row 3 has empty username
Admin,"",Invalid credentials
test123,test123,Invalid credentials
special!@#,pass123,Invalid credentials
verylongusername123456789,admin123,Invalid credentials
```

## Test Execution Output
```
About to execute step: When I enter username "" and password "admin123"
Entering credentials - Username: 
```

## Explanation
The framework correctly:
1. Reads the CSV file
2. Creates 7 scenarios (one for each data row)
3. Replaces `<username>` placeholder with the actual value from CSV
4. For row 3, the username is an empty string, which is correctly substituted

The confusion arose because:
- The CSV intentionally has an empty username to test invalid login scenarios
- The substitution showed `""` which looked like it wasn't working
- But `""` IS the correct value from the CSV file!

## To See Non-Empty Values
Run the test with a different CSV file that has all non-empty values:
- testdata/users.csv or testdata/valid_users.csv contain actual usernames
- These will show substitution like: `When I enter username "Admin" and password "admin123"`
