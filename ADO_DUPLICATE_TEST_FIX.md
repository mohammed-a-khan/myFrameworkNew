# Fix for Duplicate Test Results in Azure DevOps

## Problem
When running 2 tests mapped to Azure DevOps test cases (419 and 420), the test run was showing 4 test results:
1. "sample test 1" - Unspecified (empty placeholder)
2. "sample test 2" - Unspecified (empty placeholder)  
3. Test Case 419 - Passed (actual test)
4. Test Case 420 - Failed (actual test)

## Root Cause
When creating a test run with a Test Plan and Test Suite reference, Azure DevOps automatically:
1. Adds ALL test points from that suite to the test run
2. Creates placeholder test results for each test point with "Unspecified" status
3. This included "sample test 1" and "sample test 2" which were in the suite but not being executed

When we then posted our actual test results, they were being created as NEW test results instead of updating the existing placeholders, resulting in duplicates.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Automatic Test Point Inclusion
**File**: `CSTestRunManager.java`

**Before**: Test run was created with plan reference, which auto-included all test points
```java
// Add plan reference
if (request.planId != null || config.getTestPlanId() != null) {
    Map<String, Object> plan = new HashMap<>();
    plan.put("id", request.planId != null ? request.planId : config.getTestPlanId());
    runData.put("plan", plan);
}
```

**After**: Test run created without plan reference to prevent auto-inclusion
```java
// DON'T add plan reference during creation to avoid auto-creating test results
// We'll add plan reference when posting individual test results
// This prevents ADO from creating placeholder results for ALL test points in the suite
```

### 2. Link Test Results Directly to Test Cases
**File**: `CSTestRunManager.java` - `addTestResult()` and `addTestResults()` methods

**Enhancement**: When posting test results, directly link them to test cases and test plans
```java
// Add test case reference if available - this links the result to the test case
if (testCaseId != null) {
    Map<String, Object> testCase = new HashMap<>();
    testCase.put("id", testCaseId);
    resultData.put("testCase", testCase);
    
    // Also add test plan reference to properly link to plan
    if (testPlanId != null) {
        Map<String, Object> testPlan = new HashMap<>();
        testPlan.put("id", testPlanId);
        resultData.put("testPlan", testPlan);
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Test Run Creation**: Creates a clean test run without pre-populated test points
2. **Test Execution**: Runs only the tests that are actually in the feature file
3. **Result Posting**: Posts results only for executed tests with proper test case references
4. **Final State**: Test run contains only the tests that were actually executed

## Benefits

- ✅ No more duplicate test results
- ✅ No more "Unspecified" placeholder results  
- ✅ Only shows tests that were actually executed
- ✅ Cleaner test run view in Azure DevOps
- ✅ Test results still properly linked to test cases and test plan

## Verification

After running tests with these fixes, you should see:
- Only 2 test results (419 and 420) in the test run
- No "sample test 1" or "sample test 2" placeholders
- Proper Pass/Fail status for each executed test
- Test results linked to their test cases in the test plan

## Test Command
```bash
export ADO_PAT_TOKEN=your_token
mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=suites/ado-bdd-suite.xml
```
